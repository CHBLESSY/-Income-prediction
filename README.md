# Income-prediction
## Project Objective
 To develop a predictive model that estimates an individual's income based on demographic, educational, and occupational factors using data analysis and machine learning techniques.

## Dataset used
  - <a href="https://github.com/CHBLESSY/-Income-prediction/blob/main/adult.csv">Data set</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
 - What factors most influence income levels? (e.g., education, occupation, age, location)
 - What is the accuracy of the income prediction model? (Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE)
 - How does income distribution vary across different demographics?
 - What is the correlation between education level and income?
 - Can the model effectively classify individuals into income brackets (e.g., above or below a threshold)?

## Process
 - Data Collection – Gather relevant datasets (e.g., UCI Adult Income dataset or government labor statistics).
 - Data Preprocessing – Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers, encoding categorical variables).
 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyze trends, distributions, and correlations among features.
 - Feature Engineering – Select and transform relevant features to improve model performance.
 - Model Selection & Training – Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
 - Model Evaluation – Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE.
 - Deployment & Visualization – Present insights using Power BI, dashboards, or deploy a predictive API.
 - Optimization & Improvements – Fine-tune the model with hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.

## Project insight
 - Education & Income Correlation – Higher education levels (e.g., bachelor's, master's) tend to be strong predictors of higher income.
 - Occupational Impact – Certain job sectors (e.g., tech, finance) significantly influence income levels compared to others.
 - Gender Pay Gap – Income disparities may exist based on gender, highlighting potential biases in earnings.
 - Geographical Differences – Income varies across locations, with urban areas generally having higher earnings than rural areas.
 - Experience & Age Trends – Income typically increases with experience but plateaus or declines after a certain age.
 - Model Performance – The best-performing machine learning model and its accuracy in predicting income.
 - Feature Importance – Key factors that contribute the most to income predictions.

## Conclusion
   This income prediction project successfully identifies key factors influencing earnings, such as education, occupation, and experience. Using machine learning models, we achieved accurate income classification, providing insights into demographic and economic trends. The findings can help policymakers, businesses, and individuals make data-driven decisions. Future improvements could include incorporating more diverse datasets and refining model accuracy through advanced techniques.
